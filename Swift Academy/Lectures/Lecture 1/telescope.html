    <h1>Telescope</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
       The earliest existing record of a telescope was a 1608
       patent submitted to the government in the Netherlands by
       Middelburg spectacle maker Hans Lippershey for a refracting telescope.
       The actual inventor is unknown but word of it spread through Europe. 
       Galileo heard about it and, in 1609, built his own version, and made his telescopic observations of celestial objects.

    <h2>Types</h2>
    <p>
    The name "telescope" covers a wide range of instruments. Most detect
    electromagnetic radiation, but there are major differences in how astronomers must go about collecting light (electromagnetic radiation) in different frequency bands.
