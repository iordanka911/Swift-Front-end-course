                    The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet <a href="earth.html" target="_self">Earth</a>, being <a href="earth.html" target="_self">Earth</a>'s only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known.
