                            "China has made fruitful explorations in deep space in the 21st century," said Ye Shuhua, an
                            astronomer and member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Ye has made efforts over the
                            decades to help establish the Shanghai Astronomy Museum.

                            It is significant to build a planetarium to popularize astronomical science knowledge and
                            support the education of young people in the field, she said.

                            China has witnessed a fever for science fiction and astronomy. In 2019, the total output
                            value of China's science fiction industry was 65.87 billion yuan ($10.17 billion), up by
                            44.3 percent year on year. The box office of domestic science fiction films has doubled from
                            2018.

                            Sixty-nine percent of young Chinese people surveyed recently by the China Youth Daily felt
                            the spirit and achievements made during China's manned exploration of space were encouraging
                            and inspiring.

                            "I feel like following the path of space explorations of generations of Chinese people. We
                            are witnessing China embarking on a new space journey," said Wang Lu, a visitor from
                            Shanghai, after watching replica models of China's Chang'e-5 probe, the Mars rover Zhurong,
                            and the space station core module Tianhe.

                            "I was privileged to be part of the early stage of the museum project, and wish all the
                            success in inspiring future generations with stories about us and the universe," said Thomas
                            Kraupe, director of Planetarium Hamburg and former president of the International
                            Planetarium Society.
